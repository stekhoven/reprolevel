Reproducibility is sometimes seen as an added choreâ€”a hurdle to jump after our main analysis is done. In reality, reproducible research can save us from costly mistakes, clarify our thought processes, and foster more collaborative science. By adopting a handful of best practices, we not only help others replicate our work but also streamline our own research and reduce frustrations.

I am interested in exploring the questions, whether we can find out where we as individual researchers stand with our own research, whether there is *enough* reproducibility, and whether it is actually worth the effort?

The main element of this project is the `reprolevel_manuscript` Rmarkdown file. It contains some ideas around how we could potentially better formalise computational reproducibility and also an attempt to categorise one's own level of reproducibility. 

Feel free to work on this, improve or extend. Eventually, it will land as an article on some open access journal, but for now, it is just a draft.
